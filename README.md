Road Case Creator is a plug in for Vectorworks that generates 2D PIO to represent road cases when creating truck packs. This release is a demo that allows for up to 9 cases per drawing. 


You will need to download the .VSO and the .VWX file. The readme PDF contains instructions on where to place the .VSO file as well as instructions for how to use the tool. The .VWX file contains a worksheet that is required to use stock case sizes as well as a few PIOs already created. 

This Plug In was created and tested in VW 2021 please reach out if you need an earlier verson of the example file. 

NOTE: The .VSO file must go in the plugin folder as described in the READ ME PDF. For some reason it will not work correctly in a sub folder.
